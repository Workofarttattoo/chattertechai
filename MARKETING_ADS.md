## 📊 REDDIT POSTS

### r/entrepreneur
**Title**: [Tip] I automated 90% of customer support with AI for $297/month

**Body**:
Fellow entrepreneurs,

I see a lot of posts here about being overwhelmed with customer support. I was in the same boat 6 months ago.

Then I implemented an AI chatbot and it changed everything:

**Before:**
- 4 hours/day answering repetitive questions
- Lost customers during off-hours
- Couldn't scale without hiring

**After:**
- 30 minutes/day (just complex issues)
- 24/7 coverage
- 3x more leads

The key was getting a **custom-trained** chatbot (not a generic one).

I was so impressed I actually started a company doing this for other businesses (ChatterTech AI).

**What we learned:**
1. Generic chatbots suck - they give wrong answers
2. Custom training is worth it - needs your specific products/FAQs
3. Multi-platform matters - customers message everywhere
4. CRM integration is critical - automatic lead capture

If anyone's interested, I'm offering free demos to r/entrepreneur members. Just DM me.

Not trying to sell, just sharing what worked for me.

AMA about AI automation!

### r/smallbusiness
**Title**: Cut customer support time 90% with this setup ($297/mo)

**Body**:
Small business owner here. Want to share something that's been a game-changer.

**The problem:**
I was spending 20+ hours/week answering the same customer questions over and over. Couldn't afford to hire someone.

**The solution:**
Custom AI chatbot trained on my business.

**Here's what it handles:**
- Product questions
- Pricing inquiries
- Order status
- Appointment booking
- Basic troubleshooting

**Results after 2 months:**
- Support time: 20 hrs/week → 2 hrs/week
- Response time: 4 hours → instant
- Leads captured: +47%
- Cost: $497/month (vs $3,000/mo for a part-time person)

The key is CUSTOM training. Generic chatbots give wrong answers and frustrate customers.

Happy to answer questions about the setup!

(Disclosure: I liked it so much I started offering this service - ChatterTech AI)
